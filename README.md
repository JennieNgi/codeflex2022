# CodeFlex 2022
CodeFlex 2022, is a pilot program initiated by us, the 2nd year students of IT Web Programming Porgram in Truro Campus.
It is a competition-style event where students collaborate to solve Python and MySQL challenges in a limited amount of time. This event is designed to help students improve their coding skills, learn new techniques, and collaborate with others in a fun and supportive environment.

## Getting Started
To participate in CodeFlex, participants need to have a basic understanding of Python and MySQL.

Before the event, we provide a list of challenges for bug fix, small programs and mysql questions to participants.

## The Event
CodeFlex 2022 was a one-day event where teams of 2-4 students will work together to solve as many challenges as possible in a limited amount of time. 
Each challenge will be worth a certain number of points, and the team with the most points at the end of the event was declared the winner.
Teams were given access to a shared MySQL database and a set of pre-defined tables. 

Throughout the event, our team were available to answer questions and provide guidance. 
We also provided snacks and drinks to keep participants fueled up and ready to code!

## Submission and Judging
Teams submitted their code solutions in a limited time and our team reviewed each submission and assign points based on the correctness and efficiency of the solution.
At the end of the event, we announced the winning team and award prizes to the top performers.
